# OpenSports.bet & BataBoom.bet

Old Project but figure I upload it. Learned a lot over the course of making this. Most importantly, design is important. UID's for everything.

My odds provider was bought out, and is no longer usable. This is the last one I'm aware of and theyre decent https://the-odds-api.com/

All the meat and potatoes is pretty much in /includes/functions/* and tied to /includes/config/config.php

Went ham using M3O.com over the project for User DB, Betting DB, Comments, Etc.
